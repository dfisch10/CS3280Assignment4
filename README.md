# CS3280Assignment4

In this assignment we were tasked to create a calculator console application. Upon startup, it will printout a menu with available mathematical options. The user will then be prompted to enter an input of which operation they would like ot perform, such as in the following:

Main Menu
1) Add
2) Subtract
3) Multiply
4) Divide
5) Exit Application

Please select an option: 

Once the user selects his/her desired operation, the application will then accept at least two values (operands) to run the operation against. Once the user has selected their values/operands, the console will then output the results of the equation.

The application must follow these guidelines:

1) Supports the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2) The application needs to run in a loop so the user can do multiple calculations and not have to start the application each time.
3) Take user inputs, such as which operation to run, and the input values.
4) Display results, taking into acount remainder/decimal points for division
5) Exception handing must ensure valid inputs and valid operation order, and have error messages for invalid inputs/operation orders.
6) NUnit unit tests are required, with at least 90% coverage.
